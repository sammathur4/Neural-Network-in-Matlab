In order to learn deep learning, it is better to start from the beginning. And single layer neural network is the best starting point.
A neural network is a network or circuit of neurons, or in a modern sense, an artificial neural network, composed of artificial neurons or nodes. Thus a neural network is either a biological neural network, made up of real biological neurons, or an artificial neural network, for solving artificial intelligence (AI) problems. The connections of the biological neuron are modeled as weights. A positive weight reflects an excitatory connection, while negative values mean inhibitory connections. All inputs are modified by a weight and summed. This activity is referred to as a linear combination. Finally, an activation function controls the amplitude of the output. For example, an acceptable range of output is usually between 0 and 1, or it could be −1 and 1. These artificial networks may be used for predictive modeling, adaptive control and applications where they can be trained via a dataset. Self-learning resulting from experience can occur within networks, which can derive conclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information.

Neural networks are especially well suited to perform pattern recognition to identify and classify objects or signals in speech, vision, and control systems. They can also be used for performing time-series prediction and modeling.

# Here are a few examples of how artificial neural networks are used:
* Detecting the presence of speech commands in audio by training a deep learning model.
* Applying the stylistic appearance of one image to the scene content of a second image using neural style transfer.
* Converting handwritten Japanese characters into digital text.
* Detecting cancer by guiding pathologists in classifying tumors as benign or malignant, based on uniformity of cell size, clump thickness, mitosis, and other factors.

Deep learning is a field that uses artificial neural networks very frequently. One common application is convolutional neural networks, which are used to classify images, video, text, or sound.

Neural networks that operate on two or three layers of connected neuron layers are known as shallow neural networks. Deep learning networks can have many layers, even hundreds. Both are machine learning techniques that learn directly from input data.

Deep learning is especially well suited to complex identification applications such as face recognition, text translation, and voice recognition. It’s also a key technology used in advanced driver assistance systems and tasks including lane classification and traffic sign recognition.

A neural network combines several processing layers, using simple elements operating in parallel and inspired by biological nervous systems. It consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. In each layer there are several nodes, or neurons, with each layer using the output of the previous layer as its input, so neurons interconnect the different layers. Each neuron typically has weights that are adjusted during the learning process, and as the weight decreases or increases, it changes the strength of the signal of that neuron.

# Supervised Learning

Supervised neural networks are trained to produce desired outputs in response to sample inputs, making them particularly well suited for modeling and controlling dynamic systems, classifying noisy data, and predicting future events. Deep Learning Toolbox™ includes four types of supervised networks: feedforward, radial basis, dynamic, and learning vector quantization.


The output obtained from the network:
output =

    0.0093


output =

    0.0417


output =

    0.9895


output =

    0.9977
    
The correct output:
    0
    0
    1
    1

Hence, the output from neural network is almost equal to the correct output, hence our network is now trained.
